			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<img src="../images/meOnDrums.jpg" id="about-page-img">
			<p>Nicholas Pinzon has been involved in creating music over the
				past couple of decades. Starting from the age of six, Nick started
				to learn how to play the drums; He eventually started picking up
				guitar, bass and ukulele over the years-combining the culmination of
				his musical knowledge with his love for video games. This passion
				led to the creation of NickyStix, his solo musical project where he
				covers songs from video games.</p>

			<p>Nick's love for video game music doesn't stop there. He along
				with his brother Andrew, and veteran bassist Anthony Arma, also have
				a YouTube channel called Motion Ocean where they cover music from
				video games on their ukuleles.</p>

			<p>In October 2017, Nick Pinzon entered into his newest endeavor:
				ArmaBanks. Joining Motion Ocean bassist Anthony Arma and his
				brother, Nick, alongside friend and seasoned vocalist Larry Banks,
				these gentlemen combine a mix of rock, soul, funk, jazz, disco, and
				videogame-y vibes for an experience you'll want to come back for!</p>
